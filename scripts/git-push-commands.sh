# Add remote repository (use the correct URL)
# Option 1: If your repo is named "new-repo"
git remote add origin https://github.com/cmurphy1140/new-repo.git

# Option 2: If your repo has a different name, replace "new-repo" with the actual name
# git remote add origin https://github.com/cmurphy1140/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Set the main branch
git branch -M main

# Push to remote repository
git push -u origin main

# If you get an error about the repository not existing, you may need to:
# 1. Create the repository on GitHub first at https://github.com/new
# 2. Make sure the repository name matches what you're using in the remote URL
